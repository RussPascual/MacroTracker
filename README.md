# My Personal Project - Macro Tracker

## Description

This application is a *Macro tracker* which allows its users to track their daily meals in accordance with individual
daily nutritional goals or *macros*. Macro calculation will not be a function of this project due to needing a database
for the detailed calculations. The user can preset their caloric goal and/or weight goal. This application will track
progress and informs the user when targets have been hit. This application will update as the user records the food
eaten, the starting weight in a day, or changes their goals. The macros measured with the app include:
- Protein
- Fat
- Carbohydrates

The *Macro tracker* can be used by anyone but caters to those who have weight loss or muscle gain goals and want to do
so without professional help. This project came up because I am exactly like the user described above. I also used a
similar app named "MyFitnessPal" which offered similar services and helped me with my goals to model my project after.
