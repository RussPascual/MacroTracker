# My Personal Project - Diet Planner

## Description

This application is a *Diet tracker* which allows its users to track their daily meals in accordance with individual
daily nutritional goals or *macros*. Macros will be measured by personal data such as height, weight, gender, physical
activity, and personal goals. This application will update this information as the individual records the food eaten,
the weight gained over time, or changes their goals. The macros measured with the app include:
- Protein
- Fat
- Carbohydrates

The *Diet tracker* can be used by anyone but caters to those who have weight loss or muscle gain goals and want to do
so without professional help. This project came up because I am exactly like the user described above. I also used a
similar app which offered similar services and helped me with my goals.
